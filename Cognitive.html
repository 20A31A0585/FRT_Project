        <p><strong>What is cognitive stimulation?</strong><br />Cognitive stimulation refers to a set of techniques and strategies that are directed to improve the performance and efficacy of cognitive capabilities and executive functions such as working memory, attention, language, reasoning, and planning, among others. More concretely, cognitive stimulation is oriented toward the improvement of cognitive function.</p>
<p>What cognitive capabilities can be improved in older adults?<br />There are several cognitive capabilities and executive functions that adults can work on and strengthen to maintain optimal performance. Some of the most important capabilities are:</p>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> capability of generating, processing, directing, and maintaining an adequate activation level to process relevant information.<br /><strong>Perception:</strong> codes and coordinates the different elemental sensations to provide them with meaning.<br /><strong>Memory:</strong> registers, stores, and elicits different experiences, which could be ideas, images, events, etc.<br /><strong>Processing speed:</strong> a capability that establishes the relationship between cognitive execution and invested time. Enables fast and automatic information processing.<br /><strong>Reasoning:</strong> capability to solve problems, extract conclusions and learn consciously from events, in such a way that we can establish causal and logical relationships.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are the available activities and exercises for the cognitive stimulation of adults?</strong></em><br /><br />Adults and older adults can benefit from a variety of exercises and activities for cognitive stimulation, such as those aforementioned. Besides, a single exercise can work on more than one cognitive ability and the same ability can be strengthened by more than one exercise, resulting in a broad range of possibilities. Some of the most popular cognitive stimulation exercises are:</p>
<p><em><strong>Exercises for attention:</strong></em> the exercises directed at improving attention are based on different activities that have the objective of strengthening the different variations of attention, such as sustained attention, selective attention, and visual or auditory attention, among others.</p>
<p><em>Some of the most frequent exercises are:</em></p>
<p>A sequence of numbers is provided and the person must remember the numbers in the same order, and in the inverse order. The length of the sequence progressively increases.</p>
<p>The person must identify the X differences between two images that appear to be the same.</p>
<p><em><strong>Perception exercises:</strong></em> Perception exercises, either visual, auditory, or tactile, help improve and develop this capability in a dynamic and entertaining manner. Some of the most common activities are:</p>
<p>The person sees somebody else carrying out a sequence of beats in a melodic manner. Then hears different sound sequences. The person must identify which sound corresponds with the beats executed previously.</p>
<p>A screen displays a symbol during a short period of time. Then a set of symbols is shown and the person must indicate which symbol was previously displayed.</p>
<p><em><strong>Memory exercises:</strong></em> Memory is one of the first cognitive capabilities to start deteriorating as a consequence of age, and to counterbalance this deterioration it is important to keep the mind active and carry out different exercises, such as:</p>
<p>A set of cards is constituted by matching pairs. After shuffling the cards and distributing them, face down, on a table, the person must pick up two cards and check whether they match. If so, they are removed from the game. If not, they are placed back on the table and the person tries again.</p>
<p>The person reads a list of words. After a specific time period, the person tries to remember as many words as possible.</p>
